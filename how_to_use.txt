====================== TE+ ADDON TEMPLATE ======================
For this complement to work you MUST have also installed TE+ original datapack
=====================================================================

1.- [What you can change]
You can't change the name or the location of any of the files provided in:
- enchantplus
- enchbowcross
- technical_anvil
- load

What you need to do in those files is to go to "tags/functions/[file]" and change  ONLY the name "addon" to
to whatever your namespace want to be. 

If you do that, you can change the name of the main folder called "addon" to your namespace

You can also change the pack.png if you want
You can also change the description from the pac.kmcmeta file

2.- [Adding custom enchantments]

First of all you will need to have some basic knowledge about minecraft functions, predicates,
item modifiers, loot-tables and advancements. Also some kwnowledge about nbt data manipulation

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS AT: "addon/functions/register", it is the base your enchantment or 
 curse addon to get recognized by TE+ in first place.

I recommend to create a function that will give you a custom enchanted book for your addon in: "addon/functions/give"
This will create a book that will help you to test it with the Technical Anvil.

Then you need to go to "addon/functions/teplus/[folders]" you need to check each folder and it's files, be
careful and read the instructions correctly. In this way, you make sure you can obtain your enchantments from
the enchanting system from TE+, make your enchantment be compatible through the technical anvil and be
compatible with TE+ disenchant system.

(You need to do an extra step in case you want to create an enchantment for the bow or crossbow)
Go to: "addon/functions/bowcross/[files and folders]", check every file and follow the instructions.
This is the system that TE+ uses (made by Splatus and modified by me a bit) and prevents this type of enchantments to be buggy.

3.- [After you modify TE+ related files]

You can now add your enchantment functionallity into your datapack. The previous steps were to make your
enchantment compatible with most of TE+ features. You don't need to use all the files provided in this
template, just make sure you don't miss anything.

I highly recommend using Minecraft's log in case you're having any problems; check out the video
tutorial series: [link soon!!]; or check out the Wiki: https://github.com/Frektip/Technical-Enchant-Addons/wiki
