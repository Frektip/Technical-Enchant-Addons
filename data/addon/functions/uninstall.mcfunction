##===============================ADDON UNINSTAL FUNCTION===============================##
# - Don't forget to remove the scoreboards, tags and other things that you use for your
#    addon. This is important to do, because players may not want useless remaining data
#    in their worlds when uninstalling your addon or TE+
# - It is also recommended to run "/datapack disable [your addon name]" to avoid problems
